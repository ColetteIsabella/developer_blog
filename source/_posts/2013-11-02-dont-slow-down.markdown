## The Best Things in Life Are Free

Yeah, okay, using two songs as my title and subtitle is a little awkward, but they have really been the stories of my life since I got into Dev. I came in as an-almost-adult with a lot of education in things that were completely irrelevant to my new field, so in part, that meant I felt I needed to overcompensate, and that turned out to be the best choices I could have made.
## Code Fellows Outreach
My first venture into volunteering, was with Code Fellows. We did an outreach program for at-risk women and children in South Seattle. I have personally been lucky enough, really privaledged enough to be able to afford insanely expensive education, and have health care, and I've been realistically safe from real danger my whole life.

#### The class being introduced to Will Little, our fearless leader, and their first day of programming, for some, their first day doing anything other than searching the internet on a computer.
So meeting these people, who were so excited to learn, so kind and eager, I knew I had found something I could do to start paying back my good fortune.

Images thanks to codefellows.org. I will start with: I am not a kid person. I am generally terrible with kids, but these boys showed up, initially so convinced that computers were a waste of time, I took it as a challenge. Over the course of the first day, we had them building a sample site on their favorite subject: Skateboarding, and they were so excited, they showed up every morning, 7 am, with work they had done at home, and just the most tremendous sense of pride. I learned a little better how to be patient, how to explain these concepts in new ways, many of which helped me understand them better, and the sense of acomplishment was infective.

## RailsBridge
This is an international class platform, but takes on the personality of each of the instructors and teaching staff. In Seattle, the group who puts it on is called NIRD LLC, and awesome group whose passion is thrilling.
Rails Bridge is also a women's only class structure, but we have had many women bring their male friends and it has never been an issue. We're all just there to learn. I\'ve TA'd for them twice, gotten to know the other TA\'s (A great mix of men and women) and in one weekend we get people from "termi-waht?" to deploying their first application.

Okay, this was a little resume-y, I am just really excited as I have just signed up for my next hack-a-thon, and it's one which happily feels like it brings me closer to my ultimate desire to help the awkward and dysfunctional societal structure we muddle through. I see amazing prospects for us as a Country and a people. So on the 8th, I\'m doing the Aaron Swartz Hackathon. I will either get to continue the work he started or perhaps find others interested in working on my Mental Health awareness work.
I just found out Swartz would have been a year younger than me this month, and already, he had done so many amazing things. I do not think I am as smart as he was, but I think with help, we can make this world a better place both politically and for mental health.

tl;dr : When you find something you are passionate about, pursue it with all your heart. If you can do something that might help people, even if it is a volunteer position, you will get so much out of it. I am thrilled I found a career path where I might be able to help change the world, and I hope you can too!
