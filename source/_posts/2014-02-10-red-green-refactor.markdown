## Coding for Health

The concept of Red-Green-Refactor is a Ruby on Rails tool with testing. The idea is that you write some code, then you test it, fix it, then start all over again. With coding, there is a general understanding/joke/common sympathy that every time you find a bug, you find 10 more.

This is a bit of my life as well. I speak now and then for groups like <a href= http://geekgirlscarrots.pl/hello-english/> Geek Girls Carrots</a> and <a href= http://hackthepeople.org/>Hack the People</a> about how my life has been a winding road which in retrospect, looks a lot like this. Red-Red-Red (learn to test) -Refactor-Green-Red etc.

One of the keys to testing for me was learning and understanding the scientific method, which has a similar feel, it mostly took a lot of self-analysis and experimentation.

#### The key was accepting that I had Depression and anxiety.

So I started working on adapting my physical routine, getting exercise, and I started figuring out a medication regimen. But it was still Red-Green-Refactor again and again.

Coding was the next step. I find programming relaxing in a way few things have gotten me. I like testing and fixing and building and seeing my ideas come to life.

There are 2 projects which have been my greatest allies. First, we're back to Hack Your Brain, which over the process of a Startup Weekend became a reasonable reachable project now called <a href= http://zarkadan.com/>Zarkadan</a>. It's a self-help app with monsters, you take care of yourself, and your monster gets softer and healthier. At this point, it's still on paper and isn't functional, but I finally have a team.

One problem...
Startup Weekends no matter how hard I try, always seem to throw me into a down spiral. I've spent 2 weeks trying to pull myself
back up, and it's back to that: I don't feel like I can do anything, which makes me embarrassed that I can't do anything, which keeps me from being able to do anything. So I am just now catching up and rebooting.

My other new favorite thing is from a posting on LifeHacker. I'm not sure they really knew how incredibly useful this thing is for someone with anxiety.

First off, before I share the code, the initial code from a group called "CornDog Computers", I adapted it for my uses.

The thing is, when I am down, I spend an unreasonable, sometimes unhealthy amount of time worrying about the safety of my cats. It sometimes kept my husband and I from even going out for dinner. So thus came in, the FaceTime Cat Cam. I set up my computer or tablet angled at the cats' automatic food dispenser, and at 1 pm and 9 pm, I can call my computer and see them. They can also hear me, so I can call them to the screen and they can put nose-prints all over my screen.

If you have an Apple Computer, you have an Application called AppleScript Editor. This code is not something you want to use if you are paranoid about people seeing into your house, but you can set it up with a phone number no one but you knows. It's also possible to turn the script on and off so that you only have it on when you want it.

So you copy-paste this script into your AppleScript Terminal, and when you want it to run, you just hit the play button. Then call your computer from anywhere with facetime, and this script answers the call, and (most importantly) hangs up so it doesn't stay on or keep your phone held up.

I don't think learning to code is for everyone, but this is the first skill I have had which is helping me refactor so much easier, faster, and healthier.
