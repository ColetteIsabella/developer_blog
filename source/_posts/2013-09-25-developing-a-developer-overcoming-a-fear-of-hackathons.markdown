<h2>Seattle StartUp Weekend, a Survival Guide for Social Anxiety Sufferers</h2>
</header>
<body>
<p>This weekend was my first experience at a hackathon/StartUp Weekend. This weekend was the first time I ever really felt like I was truly in the tech world of Seattle. And it was every bit as intimidating as my imaginings which had kept me away from such things for so long.</p>
<p>So I am a natural-born networker, but my skills have a distinct limit. I can walk into a room, turn on my charm, get everyone talking to me. I walk out with a handful of business cards, and an exhaustion which strikes me to the soft squishy parts of my heart so I can't breathe. </p>
<p>Okay, that's an hour or two of crowd exposure sending me home to a bottle of Clonazepam, and sleeping pills. What on earth made me think I could take 2 and a half days of it?</p>
<p>It's a little like one of those: Prove yourself things, but also, I felt like if I didn't try it, I would never feel right calling myself a Developer.</p>
<h3>So how did I get through it?</h3>
<p>Honestly, not awesomely initially, but that's why I am describing this, because I had a great time ultimately, and nothing should keep anyone from experiencing something just because our brains are working against us.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>The week before a hackathon is not a time to be taken lightly. This may seem silly, but sleep, water, and most of all, doing something relaxing to get yourself as de-stressed as possible. I paint my nails, get my hair cut, cuddle with my husband and watch a good movie. I eat all my favorite comfort foods. Dark chocolate, avocados, kale with peanut butter, and blueberry pancakes. I am vegan, so I eat a lot of flax seed, and olive oil, but one of the best things if you have anxiety, is boney, oily fish. Salmon, tuna, lightly cooked, those Omega 3 fatty acids are fuel for you brain.</p>
<p>The next thing to set up is your supplies for the weekend. There are a few key things to prepare for:</p>
<ul>
<li>They usually provide food, drinks, and snacks, but they may not be the best, or things you can eat. If you have dietary restrictions, bring snacks you can eat, especially your favorite comfort snacks (You Will want to snack) Also, bring a water bottle, and maybe some of your favorite tea or juice, I'll explain in a bit.</li>
<li>Comfortable shoes. You'll want to get up and leave the room to recharge a bit, and uncomfortable shoes will make this needed respite easier.</li>
<li>Clothes which make you feel good. Comfortable, but nice. There is a lot of evidence that wearing clothes that make you feel attractive or strong can have a psychological affect on the wearer.</li>
<li>Headphones! This one's huge. If you need to go heads-down for a while, or just escape the room, most everyone there will recognize the universal symbol of "leave me alone"</li>
<li>If you take anti anxiety medication, bring it as a just-in-case, mine makes my head feel slow, so I try to avoid it when I need to focus, but pay attention to your body, and if you need it, take it.</li>
<li>A notebook and pens, or whatever helps you keep track, because an insane amount happens in 2 days</li>
</ul>
<h3>At The Event</h3>
<ul>
<li>Breathe. Things can get crazy and chaotic, make sure you pull yourself out when you need to.</li>
<li>You also will want to watch your caffeine and sugar intake. It's easy to drink a ton of soda and coffee, but remember, it can easily make your anxiety worse, just be attentive of what you are used to, and stay in that range. Remember to drink water.</li>
<li>A lot of emotions come up, whether you are working on your project or someone else's. Remember not to take it personally. No matter what, everyone is stressed.</li>
<li>If you need to give up, if your anxiety gets too much for you to deal with, it's okay, but check yourself thoroughly. If you can sit in quiet for a few minutes and come back, completing the weekend is going to feel so amazing just for managing to do it. But seriously, if it gets bad, step away, and checkin with yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>So those are the initial suggestions that I have for anyone wanting to overcome the social-fear part of a hackathon. There's a whole other level of doubting your abilities, and worrying that you won't find a project you want to devote yourself to, but that is a whole other issue. What I found amazing, was that once you're there, you can find a place in the crowd. And ultimately, the question is: do you want to do this?</p>
<p>Then do it. You will be glad you did.</p>
<p>But you may have to sleep it off for a few days</p>
