## Finding Direction, to get Direction

As I have mentioned in the past, I was lucky enough to get into a program to train me to program in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript and how to get into the tech world starting from less than square one. There are a lot of great resources out there to become a developer these days, but then there's a decision to make: what to do with this new found skill?

For me, the decision has been difficult, and not because I had no direction in life. From the moment I could enunciate my desires coherently, I have wanted to teach and to help people. I just never could figure out how to do that. I went to school, until I found Molecular Biology, and I thought I would do Research forever. It took a few years, but I finally found that this was not my calling.

So now I am working, everyday to increase my coding skills, front-end and back-end to make myself as useful as possible. I want to work some place where I can feel amazing, but I wanted to talk a bit about my latest project.

### Hack Your Brain

The pitch is this: In my time working in STEM, both the science and tech, I consistently see a theme in my compatriats has been a marked trouble with attention to their own health. Whether it was just something they never thought about or something they just didn't know how to, or so often, maintenance of a regimen just seemed impossible.
So I want to make an application, based on what people need and, well, Dungeons and Dragons. I want to gamify mental health.
So I've been building a framework for this. I want it to have several parts:

+ There will be several baseline starting levels, determined by the user's history, so you can start as "Never thought about it" to "Diagnosed, Medicated, but could always use more help".

+ Once a level is chosen, the user chooses the goals they want to strive for, and they can choose a series of common struggles they live with, and their level of difficulty.

+ Each struggle (like waking up in the morning) is assigned a monster we designed. Each one with an XP dependent on its difficulty level. Each one is defeatable, but will respawn if you don't keep up with the routine. There are also Completely defeatable monsters, which can be goals like "to call a doctor" or "to find the right medication" New goals can be added, and with each defeated monster, the users receive an acheivement on their profile.

+ Profiles can have 3 levels of security, either private (Only the user can see their profile), shared (You can invite friends to join, and only they can see your profile), public (Viewable to everyone, so the user can make groups for support, but it will have a report and blockable feature in case there is misuse of the site).

That's where I am starting. It is a very exciting project, and I am really enjoying working out details.
I am hoping to find a job working as a Developer so I can have a little more effect on the world, but right now, this has me really thrilled to be working on this.

Any ideas, or if you might be interested in helping at hall, send me a tweet @coletteisabella and we'll talk!
