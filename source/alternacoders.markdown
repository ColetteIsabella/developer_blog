# Welcome to AlternaCoders!

We are so lucky to live in a city like Seattle where there are so many places to find like-minded individuals or groups, but I found a group missing from the bunch.
We need more women in programming, that has been well established, but we also need a reminder that we need creative people in coding. I think there are a lot of people out there, like me, who couldn't imagine themselves fitting into the world of IT, because there is something of an expected image of a computer person.

So with the way that our world is changing, we need a place where everyone is welcome so long as they are prepared to be open minded, and welcoming to every kind of person willing to learn, teach and share ideas.

The symbol I chose for this group is the "loading" image for the Macintosh OS. I like it because it contains the symbolic rainbow denoting diversity, and the process of becoming complete. I know that reads a lot into it, but I thought it was fun.

So that's who this group is for:
Gay, Straight, Bisexual, Polysexual, Asexual, Male, Female,  Neither, experienced coder, code-curious, religious, non-religious...
But most of all, for all people still loading.

If you are interested, send me an email at coletteisabella@gmail.com,
or @coletteisabella with #alternacode

The Meetup group will be linked to when it's created.
