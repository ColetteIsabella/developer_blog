  <h1>The Programmer, as She Evolves</h1>


  <img class="img-circle" src="/source/images/FCBD2.jpg">

<p> Colette is a scientist and an artist. She got a degree in Molecular Biology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, but not until after she'd become a master beekeeper, a barista, a world traveller, an activist and a painter. She found a great deal of inspiration in science, and so she pursued the degree with vigor.</p>
<p> After several years in a lab, and teaching Introductory lab courses, her new husband, and two cats decided to move to Seattle for new adventures.</p>
<p> A bout of extreme illness caused he to reconsider her needs on a stress and mental health level. It was then she discovered coding, and pursued every avenue she could, finding the puzzle solving and building mechanisms of Ruby on Rails to be her calling.</p>
<p> She continues to make art based on her passions of technology, science and nature, and has found a passion for working with people in need through programming outreach classes and mental health seminars.</p>
<p> Today, she lives in Fremont, Seattle with her two cats, Mollybee Yoyodyne (A feisty, but cuddly, underweight survivor from the streets with a rebuilt leg and hip, and a goatee) and Dr. Patrick Fibonacci Waffles (A Russian Blue mix who can open doors but still gets his claws caught in the screen) and her husband, who is an User Experience Designer and was the inspiration for her pursuit of programming.</p>
